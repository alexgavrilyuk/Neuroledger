# Frontend Source Root (`frontend/src`)

This directory contains the source code for the NeuroLedger React frontend application, built with Vite and styled primarily using Tailwind CSS. It follows a Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) approach where applicable.

## Core Files

1.  **`main.jsx`**:
    *   **Purpose:** The main entry point for the React application.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Uses `ReactDOM.createRoot` (React 18 style) to render the application into the `index.html`'s `<div id="root">`.
        *   Imports the root `App` component.
        *   Imports global styles from `index.css`.
        *   Wraps the `App` component in `<React.StrictMode>`.

2.  **`App.jsx`**:
    *   **Purpose:** The root React component of the application.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Sets up global context providers necessary for the application:
            *   `ThemeProvider` (from `shared/contexts/ThemeContext`): Manages light/dark mode.
            *   `AuthProvider` (from `shared/contexts/AuthContext`): Manages user authentication state and data.
        *   Renders the `AppRouter` component, delegating all routing logic.

3.  **`routes.jsx`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the application's routing structure using `react-router-dom`.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Uses `createBrowserRouter` to define routes.
        *   Implements layout components (`AppLayout` for main app, `CenteredLayout` for public pages like login/signup).
        *   Defines `ProtectedRoute` component:
            *   Uses `useAuth` hook to check authentication status.
            *   Checks subscription status (`hasActiveSubscription` helper).
            *   Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.
            *   Redirects authenticated users without an active subscription to `/select-plan`.
            *   Handles loading state with a spinner.
            *   Uses `<Suspense>` to handle lazy-loaded route components.
        *   Defines `PublicOnlyRoute` component: Redirects authenticated users away from public routes (e.g., `/login`) to `/dashboard`.
        *   Defines paths for all application pages, mapping them to specific page components (mostly lazy-loaded from `./features/`). Includes nested routes for the account management section.
        *   Exports the `AppRouter` component which wraps `RouterProvider`.

4.  **`index.css`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Main global stylesheet.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities layers (`@tailwind`).
        *   Defines custom base styles (`@layer base`) for `html`, `body`, focus states, etc.
        *   Defines custom reusable component styles (`@layer components`) like `.card`, `.btn`, `.badge`.
        *   Defines custom utility classes (`@layer utilities`) like animations and gradients.

5.  **`App.css`**:
    *   Contains default CSS likely generated by the Vite React template.
    *   **Note:** Styles here may conflict with or be overridden by `index.css` (Tailwind). Consider consolidating necessary styles into `index.css` or component-specific files and removing this file if unused.

## Subdirectories

*   **`features/`**: Contains feature-specific UI components, pages, hooks, and potentially services, following the Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) pattern (e.g., `auth`, `dashboard`, `dataset_management`).
*   **`shared/`**: Contains modules and components reused across multiple features. This includes:
    *   `assets/`: Shared static assets (logos, illustrations).
    *   `components/`: Complex reusable UI components (e.g., Sidebar).
    *   `contexts/`: Global React context providers (Auth, Theme).
    *   `hooks/`: Reusable React hooks (e.g., `useAuth`, `useTheme`).
    *   `layouts/`: Main application layout wrappers (e.g., `AppLayout`).
    *   `pages/`: Generic shared pages (e.g., NotFound - though currently seems empty/unused).
    *   `services/`: API client setup (Axios) and potentially Firebase SDK init.
    *   `styles/`: (Potentially empty if all global CSS is in `index.css`).
    *   `theme/`: Theme configuration and components (e.g., ThemeSwitcher).
    *   `types/`: Shared TypeScript type definitions (if using TypeScript).
    *   `ui/`: Foundational, themeable UI building blocks (Button, Input, Card, etc.).
    *   `utils/`: General utility functions.

This structure separates application entry/setup (`main.jsx`, `App.jsx`), routing (`routes.jsx`), global styling (`index.css`), feature-specific modules (`features/`), and reusable cross-feature modules (`shared/`).
