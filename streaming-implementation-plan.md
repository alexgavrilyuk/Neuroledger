# Chat Streaming Implementation Plan

## Completed Backend Implementation

1. Added new route in `chat.routes.js`:
   - `GET /chats/:sessionId/stream` for streaming chat messages using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   
2. Added new controller method in `chat.controller.js`:
   - `streamMessage` function that sets up SSE headers and delegates to the streaming service

3. Added streaming functionality to `chat.service.js`:
   - `handleStreamingChatRequest` function to initiate the streaming process
   - `sendStreamEvent` helper to send formatted SSE events

4. Extended agent functionality in `agent.service.js`:
   - Created `StreamingAgentOrchestrator` class extending `AgentOrchestrator`
   - Added streaming-specific methods like `_sendStreamEvent` and overridden methods to handle streaming updates
   - Implemented `runAgentLoopWithStreaming` to coordinate the streaming process

5. Updated documentation:
   - Added streaming details to `backend/src/features/chat/README.md`
   - Added API documentation to `frontend/FE_BE_INTERACTION_README.md`

## Completed Frontend Implementation

1. Added streaming API client in `frontend/src/features/dashboard/services/chat.api.js`:
   - Implemented `streamChatMessage` function that sets up EventSource connection
   - Added handlers for various streaming event types
   - Implemented authentication and reconnection logic
   - Added cleanup functions for proper connection management

## Implementation Details

The streaming implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time, one-way communication from server to client
2. **Progressive Updates** through various event types:
   - `token` events for incremental text generation
   - `tool_call` and `tool_result` events to show tool usage
   - Various status events (`thinking`, `completed`, `error`, etc.)
3. **Clean State Management** storing both accumulated and incremental content
4. **Error Handling** at multiple levels (connection, processing, generation)
5. **Authentication** maintained through Firebase tokens
6. **Resource Cleanup** ensuring connections are properly closed

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Frontend UI Components**:
   - Update chat UI components to display streaming content
   - Implement incremental UI rendering for tokens
   - Add visual indicators for tool usage and status
   - Create collapsible code viewer component
   - Add loading/thinking indicators

2. **Frontend State Management**:
   - Extend chat context to handle streaming state
   - Track current streaming status (active, tools in use, etc.)
   - Manage connection lifecycle (establish, reconnect, close)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement client-side detection of iframe execution errors
   - Add UI for reporting errors back to the AI
   - Create retry/recovery flow for failed generation

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize rendering of large streaming responses
   - Implement throttling for high-frequency token events
   - Add debouncing for UI updates

5. **Testing**:
   - Test with large datasets and complex queries
   - Test with various network conditions (slow, intermittent)
   - Test error scenarios and recovery
   - Load testing for concurrent streaming connections

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Begin implementing the frontend UI components starting with:
   - Basic streaming message container
   - Token accumulation logic
   - Tool usage indicators
   
2. Integrate the streaming API into the chat context/hooks.

3. Update the chat UI to use streaming when available, with fallback to the standard API.

## Migration Strategy

To minimize disruption, we'll implement streaming as an opt-in feature initially:

1. Add a user preference toggle for enabling streaming
2. Default to the current queue-based approach for existing users
3. Gradually transition all users to streaming as stability is confirmed
